### Why Arch rather than Artix?

While Artix has earned its reputation for being fast and lightweight, our approach differs when it comes to selecting a foundation for our system. We, however, harbor reservations regarding its perceived level of security and stability. Speed is undoubtedly a crucial aspect, but our commitment to user confidence demands an equally robust foundation. Choosing a base that aligns with our stringent security and stability criteria ensures that users experience not only swiftness but also a steadfast and reliable environment. While Artix excels in certain areas, we prioritize a comprehensive balance that extends beyond speed, placing security and stability at the forefront of our considerations when building a dependable platform for our users.

Artix, essentially Arch without systemd, shares the same repositories with its counterpart, providing users with a familiar ecosystem. By aligning ourselves with the more active Arch repositories, we ensure that our users have access to the latest and most vibrant software developments. While Artix currently diverges from the systemd path, we acknowledge its prevalence and have strategic plans for accommodating systemd aspects in the future. This forward-thinking approach allows us to stay attuned to the evolving needs of our user base and maintain compatibility with the broader Arch community, fostering a dynamic environment for both current and prospective users.

Secure Arch takes a deliberate stance on prioritizing security over raw speed. While it will be designed to be lightweight, our emphasis is on fortifying the system against potential vulnerabilities, ensuring a robust defense mechanism for users. We refrain from making sweeping claims about being faster than other systems because our primary goal is to establish a secure environment. This approach seeks to strike a thoughtful balance, acknowledging that in the realm of cybersecurity, the emphasis on stability and resilience often takes precedence over sheer speed. Users can expect a nimble system, but more importantly, they can rely on Secure Arch for its unwavering commitment to providing a secure computing experience.
