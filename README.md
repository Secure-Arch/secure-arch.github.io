# Secure Arch

**Evolution in Security Simplification:**
Secure Arch isn't reinventing the wheel but rather fine-tuning it for a smoother ride through the digital landscape. Picture it as the cool upgrade to your trusted security system. Its mission is clear: to make top-tier security accessible to everyone straight out of the box. Whether you're a point-and-click fan, a terminal aficionado, or someone in between, Secure Arch is here to cater to your security needs with an array of intuitive interfaces.

**Hyprland Compositor Magic:**
What's the secret sauce behind Secure Arch's user-friendly vibe? It's the Hyprland Compositor experience – a desktop-like magic carpet ride for both newbies and tech wizards. This isn't your typical security interface; it's a seamless transition between the worlds of graphical, text-based, and command-line interactions. It's like having a security genie that understands you, whether you're a first-time user or a seasoned pro.

**Out-of-the-Box Versatility:**
Here's the kicker – Secure Arch doesn't just stop at being user-friendly; it's a security Swiss Army knife right from the get-go. With Guix, Nix, and Flatpak already in the mix, you're not just getting a system; you're getting a versatile toolbox. It's like starting your cooking adventure with a kitchen already stocked with the finest ingredients. This pre-configured setup empowers users to effortlessly tap into advanced security measures without the usual tech jargon, creating a secure playground for all skill levels.

### Why Arch rather than Artix?

While Artix has earned its reputation for being fast and lightweight, our approach differs when it comes to selecting a foundation for our system. We, however, harbor reservations regarding its perceived level of security and stability. Speed is undoubtedly a crucial aspect, but our commitment to user confidence demands an equally robust foundation. Choosing a base that aligns with our stringent security and stability criteria ensures that users experience not only swiftness but also a steadfast and reliable environment. While Artix excels in certain areas, we prioritize a comprehensive balance that extends beyond speed, placing security and stability at the forefront of our considerations when building a dependable platform for our users.

Artix, essentially Arch without systemd, shares the same repositories with its counterpart, providing users with a familiar ecosystem. By aligning ourselves with the more active Arch repositories, we ensure that our users have access to the latest and most vibrant software developments. While Artix currently diverges from the systemd path, we acknowledge its prevalence and have strategic plans for accommodating systemd aspects in the future. This forward-thinking approach allows us to stay attuned to the evolving needs of our user base and maintain compatibility with the broader Arch community, fostering a dynamic environment for both current and prospective users.

Secure Arch takes a deliberate stance on prioritizing security over raw speed. While it will be designed to be lightweight, our emphasis is on fortifying the system against potential vulnerabilities, ensuring a robust defense mechanism for users. We refrain from making sweeping claims about being faster than other systems because our primary goal is to establish a secure environment. This approach seeks to strike a thoughtful balance, acknowledging that in the realm of cybersecurity, the emphasis on stability and resilience often takes precedence over sheer speed. Users can expect a nimble system, but more importantly, they can rely on Secure Arch for its unwavering commitment to providing a secure computing experience.

# Notes on Development

Secure Arch takes a deliberate stance on prioritizing security over raw speed. While it will be designed to be lightweight, our emphasis is on fortifying the system against potential vulnerabilities, ensuring a robust defense mechanism for users. We refrain from making sweeping claims about being faster than other systems because our primary goal is to establish a secure environment. This approach seeks to strike a thoughtful balance, acknowledging that in the realm of cybersecurity, the emphasis on stability and resilience often takes precedence over sheer speed. Users can expect a nimble system, but more importantly, they can rely on Secure Arch for its unwavering commitment to providing a secure computing experience.

Looking ahead, our roadmap includes a strategic evolution in pursuit of enhanced system efficiency. Down the road, we plan to make improvements by phasing out the systemd init system. This move is aimed at optimizing the system's performance and elevating its speed without compromising the fortified security measures that users have come to trust. As we refine Secure Arch, we recognize the evolving landscape of user expectations and are committed to adapting to these changes, ensuring a seamless, secure, and now even swifter computing experience.

The decision to remove the systemd init system is not just about speed; it's a proactive step to fine-tune the balance between performance and security. By streamlining the system's initiation process, we anticipate a tangible boost in overall speed, contributing to a more responsive and efficient computing environment. This optimization aligns with our commitment to continuous improvement, ensuring that Secure Arch remains a reliable choice for users who value both security and performance.

While the transition away from systemd may be a significant change, users can rest assured that our commitment to security remains unwavering. The roadmap reflects our dedication to providing a secure yet agile system, evolving with the ever-changing demands of modern computing. As we pave the way for increased speed, users can anticipate a future where Secure Arch seamlessly integrates both optimal performance and steadfast security, creating a well-rounded computing experience that meets the needs of a diverse user base.

In addition to our commitment to security, Secure Arch harnesses the ALHP and CachyOS repositories to enrich the user experience. The collaboration with these repositories enables us to offer users an extensive array of software options, promoting flexibility and choice. This integration aligns with our vision of providing users with a versatile and well-rounded computing environment. However, it's crucial to clarify that beyond this collaborative utilization of repositories, Secure Arch maintains autonomy in its development and design, forging its path in the Linux distribution landscape.

While ALHP and CachyOS repositories play a pivotal role in expanding software availability, our association with these entities is limited to this specific aspect. Secure Arch stands apart in its philosophy, development approach, and community engagement. We emphasize that our collaboration with the repositories does not extend to shared governance or any other substantial organizational affiliation. Secure Arch remains an independent entity committed to security, evolving to meet user expectations while drawing upon the strengths of collaborative efforts for an enhanced software ecosystem.
